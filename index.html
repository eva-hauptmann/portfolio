<h2>About Eva</h2>
  <p>I am currently working as a bartender at a steakhouse located within the Houston area. While I have enjoyed my last few years in the hospitality industry and have learned a lot, I have recently found interest in web development. </p>

  <p>I decided to join Thinkful's software engineering program and have been loving it!
As I have progressed through the curriculum, it has been exciting to learn something new and challenging. I look forward to implementing my new knowledge into future projects as well as connecting with other software developers along the way.  </p>
